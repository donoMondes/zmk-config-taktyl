  Input driver for Microchip maxTouch devices

include: ["i2c-device.yaml"]

compatible: "microchip,maxtouch"

properties:
  chg-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: CHG pin for the device
    required: true
  max-touch-points:
    type: int
    default: 5
  repeat-each-cycle:
    type: boolean
    description: Repeat events for any active touches each scan, even if no changes detected.
  swap-xy:
    type: boolean
  invert-x:
    type: boolean
  invert-y:
    type: boolean
  idle-acq-time-ms:
    type: int
    default: 32
  active-acq-time-ms:
    type: int
    default: 10
  active-to-idle-timeout-ms:
    type: int
    default: 50
  sensor-width:
    type: int
    description: The physical width of the sensor in millimeters.
    required: true
  sensor-height:
    type: int
    description: The physical height of the sensor in millimeters.
    required: true
  touch_threshold:
    type: int
    description: Touches must exceed this threshold before they generate an event. Higher thresolds are good for tracking smaller objects. Changes to the sensor surface, or the gain may require this value to be changed.
    default: 18
  touch_hysteresis:
    type: int
    description: A hysteresis for touches dropping our of detection. Changes to the sensor surface, or the gain may require this value to be changed.
    default: 8
  internal_touch_threshold:
    type: int
    description: A secondary touch thresold used internally by the sensor. Changes to the sensor surface, or the gain may require this value to be changed.
    default: 10
  internal_touch_hysteresis:
    type: int
    description: A secondary hysteresis used internally by the sensor. Changes to the sensor surface, or the gain may require this value to be changed.
    default: 4
  gain:
    type: int
    description: The transmit power. Higher values allow the use of thicker touch surfaces or higher touch thresholds.
    default: 4
  charge_time:
    type: int
    default: 10
  allowed_measurement_types:
    type: int
    description: Some sensor configurations place restrictions on the available measurement types. A value of 1 (mutual capacitance only) will always work.
    default: 3
  active_syncs_per_x:
    type: int
    default: 20
  idle_syncs_per_x:
    type: int
    default: 20
  retransmission_compensation_disable:
    type: boolean
